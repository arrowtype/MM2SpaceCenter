<p>This extension generates a list of words in Robofont’s Space Center based on the current pair you’re kerning in the <a href="https://extensionstore.robofont.com/extensions/metricsMachine/">Metrics Machine</a> extension by Tal Leming.</p>


<p>The wonderful <a href="https://github.com/ninastoessinger/word-o-mat">word-o-mat</a> extesions by Nina Stössinger was a major influence, and this would most certainly not exist if Nina’s word-o-mat hadn’t come first. And thanks to Stephen Nixon for asking about something like this, which encouraged me to share this. I would love to see this extension evolve to have nice menus and an interface as powerful as word-o-mat someday.</p>

<p>Pull requests are greatly appreciated 🙏</p>
